# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to further help the client analyze her Kickstarter campaign by creating tables and 
graphs of similar campaigns to present data for outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using data from the main Kickstarter spreadsheet I created a pivot table and line graph to show successful, failed, or canceled
outcomes based on the month they were launched. The first step was to create a new column in the Kickstarter sheet that pulled the year 
from the date created column, creating a new data field.

The pivot table is filtered to show data for the Theater parent category and can be 
further filtered by Year. ![outcomes based on lauch date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10662651/159349583-0520a179-fa88-42c8-8b62-0b0c61f16210.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Next, I created a table and line graph to show successful, failed, and canceled outcome counts and 
the percentages of each based on a range of campaign dollar goals. This data was filtered to only show outcomes for the Play 
subcategory from the main Kickstarter data set. ![outcomes based on goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10662651/159350180-348ecd57-fd0d-413c-852f-6e19a028fa7e.png)


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only challenge or difficulty I've encountered is the actual written analysis for this project. This is the first time I've had to describe and analyze
data and it definitly seems like a skill that grows with time and practice. Organizing and manipulating data has come much more naturaly. Challenges could 
arise if the original data was incomplete or orgnanized poorly, causing issues with any tables derived from that data, but this was not the case with Kickstarter
data I was working with.
## Results

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date Conclusions
Based on the data set the best time of year to launch a campaign are the months of May and June. These months had the highest totals of successful
campaigns and show a nearly 2 to 1 ratio between successful ones and failed and canceled outcomes combined. December shows to be the least favorable 
month to kick off a campaign. While not having the highest amount of failed Kickstarters, it shows almost an even split between successful and the 
combination of failed and canceled outcomes.

### Outcomes Based on Goals Conclusions
Goals up to $5000 had the highest rate of success as these smaller goals had an almost 3 to 1 success rate.

### Dataset Limitations
The only possible limitations from this data I can come up with is that both tables may be too broad for what the 
client is seeking in relation to her campaign. The data from Outcomes Based on Launch Date can be further filtered to only 
show outcomes from the Plays subcategory from the U.S., and the Outcomes Based on Goals table can be further filtered to only show 
Plays outcomes from the U.S. as well.

### Other Possible Tables or Graphs
Outside of tables applying the filters I mentioned in Dataset Limitations, using a bar graph to show the data for the Outcomes Based on Goals
table may be better visual representation of that data set.
