# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to further help the client analyze her Kickstarter campaign by creating tables and 
graphs of similar campaigns to present data for outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using data from the main Kickstarter spreadsheet I created a pivot table and line graph to show successful, failed, or canceled
outcomes based on the month they were launched. The first step was to create a new column in the Kickstarter sheet that pulled the year 
from the date created column, creating a new data field.

The pivot table is filtered to show data for the Theater parent category and can be 
further filtered by Year. ![outcomes based on lauch date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10662651/159349583-0520a179-fa88-42c8-8b62-0b0c61f16210.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Next, I created a table and line graph to show successful, failed, and canceled outcome counts and 
the percentages of each based on a range of campaign dollar goals. This data was filtered to only show outcomes for the Play 
subcategory from the main Kickstarter data set. ![outcomes based on goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10662651/159350180-348ecd57-fd0d-413c-852f-6e19a028fa7e.png)


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only challenge or difficulty I've encountered is the actual written analysis for this project. This is the first time I've had to describe and analyze
data and it definitly seems like a skill that grows with time and practice. Organizing and manipulating data has come much more naturaly. Challenges could 
arise if the original data was incomplete or orgnanized poorly, causing issues with any tables derived from that data, but this was not the case with Kickstarter
data I was working with.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
